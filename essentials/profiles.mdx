## What is a Profile?

A **Profile** in Ankra is a saved configuration for an add-on, including values, secrets, and overrides. Profiles enable you to quickly replicate and manage add-on setups across your clusters.

## Why Use Profiles?

- **Reuse Configurations:**  
  Apply the same profile to any cluster to instantly replicate your preferred add-on setup.

- **Update Multiple Clusters:**  
  Modify a profile and roll out changes to all clusters using it, ensuring consistency and saving time.

- **Enforce Best Practices:**  
  Standardize configurations for security, compliance, or operational excellence across your organization.

- **Simplify Management:**  
  Manage complex add-on settings in one place and avoid manual, error-prone updates.
