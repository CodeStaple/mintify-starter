# Manifests

<Note>
Manifests are the foundation for customizing your Kubernetes clusters in Ankra. They allow you to define, automate, and standardize resources and configurations across all your environments.
</Note>

## What is a Manifest?

A **manifest** is a YAML file that describes Kubernetes resources—such as namespaces, ConfigMaps, CRDs, RBAC rules, deployments, and more. Manifests are declarative, meaning you specify the desired state and Kubernetes ensures your cluster matches it.

---

## Why Use Manifests in Ankra?

- **Automate Cluster Setup:**  
  Automatically create all required resources (namespaces, roles, CRDs, etc.) as part of your cluster provisioning or stack deployment.

- **Ensure Consistency:**  
  Apply the same manifest to multiple clusters to guarantee every environment is configured identically.

- **Prepare for Add-ons:**  
  Use manifests to set up prerequisites for add-ons (e.g., custom resource definitions or service accounts) so add-on installation is seamless.

- **Version Control:**  
  Store manifests in your repository to track changes, enable rollbacks, and support GitOps workflows.

## How to Use Manifests in Ankra

1. **Create or Upload:**  
   Write your manifest YAML or upload an existing file in the Ankra platform.

2. **Include in Stacks:**  
   Add manifests to a stack to automate the setup of foundational resources alongside your add-ons.

3. **Apply to Clusters:**  
   Deploy manifests directly to one or many clusters, either manually or as part of a stack rollout.

## Example Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: monitoring
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: monitoring
  name: monitoring-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "services"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

Manifests are a powerful way to automate, standardize, and scale your Kubernetes operations with Ankra.
