# Stacks

<Note>
Stacks let you bundle add-ons, profiles, and manifests into a reusable, versioned package—making it easy to deploy consistent Kubernetes environments at scale.
</Note>

## What is a Stack?

A **Stack** in Ankra is a collection of add-ons, profiles, and manifests grouped together to define a complete Kubernetes environment. Stacks are reusable and can be versioned, shared, and deployed to any cluster.

---

## Why Use Stacks?

- **Consistency Across Environments:**  
  Deploy the same stack to dev, staging, and production to ensure every environment is configured identically.

- **Accelerate Onboarding:**  
  New clusters or teams can be up and running in minutes by applying a pre-built stack.

- **Simplify Updates:**  
  Update a stack and roll out changes to all clusters using it, reducing manual work and configuration drift.

- **Promote Best Practices:**  
  Share stacks across your organization to enforce standards and recommended configurations.

## How to Use Stacks in Ankra

1. **Create a Stack:**  
   Combine add-ons, profiles, and manifests in the Ankra platform to define your stack.

2. **Version and Share:**  
   Save and version your stack for easy reuse. Share stacks with your team or organization.

3. **Deploy to Clusters:**  
   Apply a stack to one or many clusters to instantly provision all included resources and configurations.

## Example Stack Composition

- **Add-ons:** Monitoring, Ingress, Logging
- **Profiles:** Pre-configured Helm values for each add-on
- **Manifests:** Namespaces, RBAC, CRDs

Stacks make it easy to manage, scale, and standardize your Kubernetes infrastructure—no matter how complex your needs.
